### Procedure

**(a) Determination of Heat Capacity of the Calorimeter**

*Step 1:*
Inspect the wax lining of the calorimeter carefully to ensure that there are no cracks or defects, and then click on the cork to properly seal the calorimeter. Click on the pipette to take the required quantity of nitric acid and then click on the beaker to transfer it into the calorimeter, ensuring that the acids are added without spillage.

*Step 2:*
Click on the zinc oxide and ignite it for one hour at a temperature of 900–950°C in the muffle furnace. Click on the muffle furnace to open it, then click on the crucible to place the zinc oxide inside. Click on the green button to start the timer for ignition. After completion of heating, click on the crucible and allow the ignited zinc oxide to cool in a desiccator for the specified duration. Click on Next to proceed.

*Step 3:*
Click on Tare to tare the balance, then click on the spatula to accurately weigh 7 g of ignited zinc oxide. Click on the crucible to place it again in the muffle furnace for reheating, and after heating, click on the crucible to cool it once more in the desiccator to ensure complete ignition.

*Step 4:*
Assemble the calorimeter properly and click on the Start button to initiate the experiment. Click on the crucible to transfer the zinc oxide into the calorimeter gradually. Record the temperature readings at one-minute intervals during the reaction. Plot the temperature–time graph, and determine the initial and final heating or cooling corrections. These corrections shall be summed and added or subtracted as appropriate to the observed temperature rise. Using the given formula, calculate the heat capacity of the calorimeter.

**Formula for Heat Capacity of Calorimeter:**

where
Φ = final temperature of the calorimeter (°C)
Φ₀ = room temperature (°C)

**(b) Preparation of Cement Sample**

*Step 5:*
Click on Tare to tare the weighing balance and then click on the spatula to weigh the required quantity of cement. Click on the measuring cylinder to measure 24 ml of distilled water and add it to the cement. Mix the cement and water thoroughly to obtain a uniform paste. Transfer the paste into the containers, cork them, seal with wax, and store the samples in a vertical position at 27 ± 2°C. Click on Next.

**(c) Determination of Heat of Solution and Heat of Hydration**

*Step 6:*
Click on Tare to tare the balance and then click on the spatula to weigh about 3 g of unhydrated cement sample for the heat of solution test. Click again on the spatula to weigh an additional 7 g sample for determining the loss on ignition. Click on the crucible to transfer the cement sample into the calorimeter, and then check the final observation table.

*Step 7:*
Click on the crucible to place the sample into the muffle furnace, and click on the muffle furnace to open it. After ignition, click on the crucible and place it into the desiccator for cooling. Click on Tare to tare the plate’s weight, then click on the cement sample to weigh it accurately after ignition.

*Step 8:*
Carry out the required calculations and determine the heat of solution of unhydrated cement using the given formula.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?$$\frac{\text{Heat&space;Capacity}\times\text{Corrected&space;Temperature&space;Rise}}{\text{Mean&space;of&space;Sample&space;Corrected&space;for&space;Ignition&space;Loss}}-0.8(\Phi-\Phi)$$" alt="Heat of Solution Formula">

where 0.8 is the specific heat of unhydrated cement.

*Step 9:*
Calculate the mean of three readings obtained within 7 days of mixing the hydrated cement samples. Finally, compute the heat of hydration of the cement sample using the observed values.
