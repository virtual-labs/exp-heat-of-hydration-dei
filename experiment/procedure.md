#### Step 1: Preparation of zinc oxide and calorimeter
• Inspect the wax lining of the calorimeter carefully and ensure it is free from faults.
<br><img src="procedure_images/1.1.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Measure 9.6 ± 0.1 ml of hydrofluoric acid and add it to the calorimeter.  <br><img src="procedure_images/1.2.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Place the crucible containing zinc oxide inside the muffle furnace.<br>

• Measure 388.0 ± 0.1 ml of 2.0 N nitric acid into the calorimeter using a standard flask.<br><img src="procedure_images/1.3.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Close the muffle furnace door securely.<br>

• Weigh a sufficient quantity of zinc oxide for about six determinations into a clean crucible.

• Click on the muffle furnace door to open it .
 <br><img src="procedure_images/1.5.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the crucible to place zinc oxide in the muffle furnace.
 <br><img src="procedure_images/1.6.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Set the temperature to 900–950 °C and ignite zinc oxide for one hour by clicking in the green button.
 <br><img src="procedure_images/1.7.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• After ignition, remove the crucible with zinc oxide from the furnace by clicking on the furnance door.<br><img src="procedure_images/1.8.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the crucible to cool the ignited zinc oxide in a desiccator containing anhydrous calcium chloride.<br><img src="procedure_images/1.9.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on NEXT to proceed.<br>

#### Step 2: Heating zinc oxide sample for each determination
• Click on the tare button of the balance to adjust and ensure exactly about 7.0 g of ignited zinc oxide is measured.<br><img src="procedure_images/2.1.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the trowel or spatula to add ignited zinc oxide into the crucible until the desired amount is obtained.<br><img src="procedure_images/2.2.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the furnace door handle to open it .
<br><img src="procedure_images/2.3.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the crucible to place it inside the muffle furnace.<br><img src="procedure_images/2.4.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the furnace door handle again to close it and heat the crucible at 900–950 °C for 5 minutes.<br><img src="procedure_images/2.5.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Remove the crucible from the furnace and click on the crucible to place it in the desiccator containing anhydrous calcium chloride to cool the reheated zinc oxide for 2.5–5 hours.

• Click on NEXT to proceed.<br>

### Step 3: Operation of calorimeter and addition of zinc oxide

• Click on the power switch of the calorimeter unit to start the stirrer and run it for at least 5 minutes to obtain a uniform temperature. Record the temperature (to 0.001°C) at one-minute intervals for 5 minutes to determine the initial heating or cooling correction.<br><img src="procedure_images/3.1.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the crucible containing zinc oxide and pour the powder steadily through the funnel into the calorimeter over 1–2 minutes, then brush the funnel clean with a camel-hair brush.

• Click on NEXT to proceed 

#### Step 4: Preparation and weighing of cement samples
• Click on the tare button of the balance to zero it.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.1.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the trowel to add cement onto the pan and accurately weigh 60 g of cement.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.2.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the measuring cylinder to measure 24 ml of distilled water and add it to the weighed cement, then mix thoroughly to a uniform paste.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.3.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the tare button of the larger balance to zero it before weighing the main cement batch.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.4.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the trowel to transfer cement from the bag into the dish until about 3.0 g is obtained for the heat of solution test.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.5.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
•	Click on the trowel again to collect and place an additional cement portion of approximately 7.0 g in another dish for loss-on-ignition determination. 
<br><img src="procedure_images/4.6.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

•	Click on the dish containing the cement sample to place it near the calorimeter for carrying out the temperature-rise determination exactly as in Step 3 using the same calorimeter and correction procedure.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.7.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the crucible containing the cement sample and place it inside the muffle furnace, then heat it at 900 °C for 3–4 hours.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.8.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on the furnance door to remove the heated cement sample from the furnace.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.10.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the crucible again and place the hot cement sample in a desiccator containing anhydrous calcium chloride to cool it.<br><img src="procedure_images/4.11.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the tare button of the balance to zero it before weighing the cooled cement sample.
 <br><img src="procedure_images/4.12.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>
 
• Click on the crucible with cooled cement and place it on the balance pan to weigh the sample accurately to the nearest milligram.  
<br><img src="procedure_images/4.13.png" alt="procedure" width="500"><br>

• Click on NEXT to proceed.
